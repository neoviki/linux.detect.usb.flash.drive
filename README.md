# USB Flash Drive Detector

A Linux command-line utility that monitors your system for newly connected USB flash drives in real time.

This tool helps you identify USB sticks, showing their **device path, vendor, model, and size**,  while ignoring large external hard drives.

---

## Whatâ€™s the Purpose of This Utility?

1. **Detect newly inserted USB flash drives** in real time and display their device paths, vendor, model, and size.
2. **Useful when creating bootable USB drives** - helps you identify the correct target device (e.g., `/dev/sdb`) before using tools like `dd`.
   This prevents accidental overwriting of your **internal hard drive**, which can lead to **data loss or corruption**.
